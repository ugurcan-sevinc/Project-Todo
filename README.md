# Project-Todo
Early phases of a to-do application with step counter, shop-list and calendar features built in.

### Draft design of Application

#### Update: I have decided to revamp the overall user interface and user experience of my application, and therefore I have temporarily halted its development. My aim is to create an application that is fully compatible with Material Design 3, and offers a more polished and professional experience for its users. Thank you for your understanding. Additionally, please ensure that my message is grammatically correct. 

Although I made a demo and pushed it as One Task Man. You can check it there: https://github.com/ugurcan-sevinc/OneTaskMan
